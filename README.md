# This is Pixel! please say hi to him!!!!

Hi hello there uhhh i'm Pixel!!!!!!!!!!
I have no idea why you're here but hello!!!
I don't really do much over here, mostly just store the source codes for some of my projects on here so I can collaborate with others more efficiently, plus have a backup if anything goes wrong with my PC! Mostly the former.

## My Current Projects

- A Week At Eli's: Remastered (Unreleased)
- pixel swag mod (Unreleased)
- too much other stuff to count send help
  
## My Former/Canned Projects

- Eli's Art Class/Eli's Art Class Remastered (Canned due to development issues.)
- pixel sigma mod (Canned because it SUCKED!)
- FNF': VS. Drawnic (Ditto.)
