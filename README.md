# This is Pixel! please say hi to him!!!!

Hi hello there uhhh i'm PixelThistle!!!!!!!!!!
I have no idea why you're here but hello!!!
I don't really do much over here (that's public, anyways...), mostly just store the source codes for some of my projects on here so I can collaborate with others more efficiently, plus have a backup if anything goes wrong with my PC! Mostly the former, lol.

## My Current Projects

- A Week At Eli's: Remastered (Unreleased)
- FNF': Pixel's Parody Palooza! (Unreleased)
- FNF': VS. Eli DX (Unreleased)
- too much other stuff to count send help
  
## My Former/Canned Projects

- Eli's Art Class/Eli's Art Class Remastered (Canned due to bitchyear- I mean development issues.)
- Pixel's Wonderous House! (Canned because I forgot it existed (oops))
- pixel sigma mod (Canned because it SUCKED!)
- FNF': VS. Drawnic (Ditto.)
- FNF': The Eli Files (Ditto again.)
